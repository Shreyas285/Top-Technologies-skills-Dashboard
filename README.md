# Top-Technologies-skills-Dashboard

A global IT and business consulting services firm wants to keep pace with changing technologies and remain competitive in the IT field. The company regularly  analyze data to help identify top present and future skill requirements.

As a data analyst, I have been tasked to analyze and identify insights for the emerging skills from the data. Then from the insights obtained, create dashboard using IBM Cognos Analytics that will display top trends in skill requirements for the IT field.

# About dataset 

The dataset is taken from Stack Overflow .Stack Overflow, a popular website for developers, conducted an online survey of software professionals across the world. It is the largest and most comprehensive survey of people who code around the world. 
The survey data was later open sourced by Stack Overflow. The data set has around 90,000 responses.
I am going to analyze a subset of data in this project.This randomised subset contains around 1/10th of the original data set.
